## Fork Status

This repository started as a fork of the upstream project. Over time it has
diverged significantly, and keeping a steady PR workflow upstream became
impractical. This fork has left the upstream fork network and is maintained
independently.

We are grateful to upstream and fully respect the Apache-2.0 license and
attribution requirements.

This fork is not affiliated with or endorsed by the upstream maintainers.

## Overview

AI coding agents are increasingly writing the world's code and human engineers
now spend the majority of their time planning, reviewing, and orchestrating
tasks. Vibe Kanban streamlines this process, enabling you to:

- Switch between different coding agents
- Orchestrate multiple coding agents in parallel or in sequence
- Review work quickly and start dev servers
- Track the status of tasks your agents are working on
- Centralize MCP configuration for coding agents
- Open projects remotely via SSH when running on a remote server
