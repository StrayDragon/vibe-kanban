description: "How to use the cross-project All Tasks page and confirm it matches the project kanban task panel"
---

The All Tasks page gives you one place to review and manage tasks across all
projects. It uses the same task detail and attempt panels as the project
kanban, so the behavior and actions stay consistent.

## Open the page

- Use the main navigation menu and select **All Tasks**.
- Or go directly to `/tasks`.

## What you can do

- View tasks grouped by project, with per-project status counts.
- See each task status badge (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done, Cancelled).
- Use the global search input to filter tasks by title/description.
- Click any task to open the right-side panel.
- Create new tasks from the project kanban only (All Tasks is read-only for task creation).

## Panel behavior (same as project kanban)

The All Tasks detail panel reuses the same components as the project kanban:

- **Task panel**: title, description, attempt list, and create attempt action.
- **Attempt panel**: logs, follow-up, todo list, diffs, and preview.
- **Actions**: edit, duplicate, delete, open in editor, view processes, etc.

Routes update the same way, just under `/tasks`:

- Task: `/tasks/:projectId/:taskId`
- Attempt: `/tasks/:projectId/:taskId/attempts/:attemptId`

If a task has no attempts yet, the sidebar shows a short empty state with a
**Create new attempt** button. This keeps the workflow focused on the same
sidebar experience as the project kanban.

## After merging to mainline

When you pull the merged changes locally, run:

```bash
pnpm i
```

If you do not have SQLx CLI yet:

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli --no-default-features --features sqlite
```

Refresh the SQLx offline cache:

```bash
pnpm run prepare-db
```

Then verify and start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm run check
pnpm run dev
```

If ports are in use, you can override them:

```bash
FRONTEND_PORT=4001 BACKEND_PORT=4002 pnpm run dev
```

Finally, open `/tasks` and confirm the panel matches the project kanban view.

## Troubleshooting

- **No tasks listed**: create tasks in any project first, then return to
  `/tasks`.
- **WebSocket errors**: restart the dev server and ensure `BACKEND_PORT`
  matches the Vite proxy target.
